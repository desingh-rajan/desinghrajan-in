# Tech Stack Decision: Next.js vs Ruby on Rails

## 🤔 **Your Current Situation**

**Infrastructure:**

- Domain: desinghrajan.in (GoDaddy)
- Server: Vultr VPS (1GB RAM, 1vCPU, Ubuntu 24.04)
- Setup: Nginx + SSL configured
- Current: Simple index.html (to be replaced)

**Requirements:**

- Solo developer (you)
- Portfolio → Business platform evolution
- Dockerized deployment
- Resource constraints (1GB RAM)

## ⚖️ **Stack Comparison Analysis**

### 🟢 **Ruby on Rails - RECOMMENDED for Solo Dev**

#### **Pros:**

✅ **"Batteries Included"** - Authentication, database, forms, validations, etc.  
✅ **Single Repository** - No frontend/backend split  
✅ **Rapid Development** - Convention over configuration  
✅ **Memory Efficient** - Runs comfortably on 1GB RAM  
✅ **Full-Stack in One** - No API complexity  
✅ **Strong Conventions** - Less decision fatigue  
✅ **Built-in Asset Pipeline** - SCSS, TypeScript, bundling included  
✅ **Mature Ecosystem** - Gems for everything you need  

#### **Rails Memory Usage:**

- **Development:** ~200-300MB
- **Production:** ~400-600MB (with caching)
- **Your 1GB VPS:** Perfect fit with room to spare

#### **Modern Rails Stack (2025):**

```ruby
# Your ideal stack
Rails 8+ with:
- Built-in authentication (no Devise needed!)
- Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) for SPA-like experience  
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ViewComponents for reusable UI
- SQLite database (dev AND production!)
- Solid Queue/Cache (SQLite-based, no Redis needed)
- Kamal 2.0 for deployment
- Dockerfile included by default
```

### 🟡 **Next.js + Express - More Complex**

#### **Pros:**

✅ **Modern JavaScript** - If you prefer JS/TS  
✅ **Great Performance** - Static generation + SSR  
✅ **Large Ecosystem** - npm packages  
✅ **Flexible Architecture** - Microservices ready  

#### **Cons:**

❌ **Double Repository Maintenance** - Frontend + Backend  
❌ **More Configuration** - Auth, database, API setup  
❌ **Higher Memory Usage** - Node.js + Next.js = ~800MB+  
❌ **API Complexity** - REST/GraphQL layer needed  
❌ **Decision Overload** - Too many choices for solo dev  

## 🎯 **Recommendation: Go with Ruby on Rails**

### **Why Rails is Perfect for Your Use Case:**

1. **Solo Developer Efficiency**
   - One codebase to maintain
   - Built-in solutions for common needs
   - Less time configuring, more time building

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Fits perfectly in 1GB RAM
   - Efficient database queries with ActiveRecord
   - Built-in caching strategies

3. **Business Growth Ready**
   - Easy to add authentication (Devise)
   - Built-in admin panels (ActiveAdmin)
   - Payment integration (Stripe gems)
   - Background jobs (Sidekiq)

4. **Modern Development Experience**
   - Hotwire for SPA-like interactions
   - Tailwind CSS integration
   - TypeScript support
   - Docker-ready

## 🚀 **Recommended Rails Architecture**

### **Phase 1: Portfolio (Static + Forms)**

```ruby
# Minimal Rails app
- Static pages (About, Portfolio, Contact)
- Contact form with ActionMailer
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Responsive design
```

### **Phase 2-6: Business Features**

```ruby
# Full business platform
- User authentication (Devise)
- Client portal (multi-tenancy)
- Project management
- Domain/hosting tracking
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Admin dashboard
```

### **Server Resource Usage Estimate (Your 1GB VPS with Rails 8 + SQLite):**

```
Rails 8 App (Puma):  200-300MB  # Even more efficient!
SQLite database:     10-20MB    # Single file, super light
No Redis needed:     0MB        # Solid Queue uses SQLite!
Nginx:              10-20MB     # Minimal footprint  
System (Ubuntu):    150-200MB   # Base system
Docker overhead:    50-80MB     # Container management
------------------------
Total:              420-620MB   # 380-580MB free buffer!
```

**With Rails 8 + SQLite, you're using HALF the memory and getting better performance!**

## 🐳 **Docker Setup for Rails**

Rails 7+ includes Dockerfile by default:

```dockerfile
# Generated automatically
FROM ruby:3.2-slim
# Optimized for production
# Includes all necessary dependencies
```

## 📊 **Development Speed Comparison**

### **Rails (Estimated Timeline)**

- **Week 1:** Portfolio with contact form ✅
- **Week 2:** Blog system with admin ✅
- **Week 3:** User authentication ✅
- **Week 4:** Client portal basics ✅

### **Next.js + Express (Estimated Timeline)**

- **Week 1:** Project setup + basic frontend ⚠️
- **Week 2:** API setup + database ⚠️
- **Week 3:** Authentication integration ⚠️
- **Week 4:** Still working on foundations ❌

## 💡 **Final Recommendation**

**Choose Ruby on Rails because:**

1. **Perfect for 1GB VPS** - Efficient memory usage
2. **Solo developer friendly** - One codebase, less complexity
3. **Rapid development** - Built-in solutions for everything
4. **Future-proof** - Scales from portfolio to business platform
5. **Modern tooling** - Hotwire, Tailwind, Docker ready

## 🔧 **Next Steps if You Choose Rails**

```bash
# Quick start command you can use:
"Setup Rails 7 portfolio with Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, and Docker"
```

This will give you:

- Modern Rails app with your domain
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker configuration
- Nginx proxy setup
- SSL ready

**Would you like me to proceed with the Rails setup?** It's honestly the smartest choice for your situation as a solo developer with resource constraints who wants to build a growing business platform efficiently.

Rails will get you to market faster and let you focus on your business instead of managing multiple codebases! 🚀
