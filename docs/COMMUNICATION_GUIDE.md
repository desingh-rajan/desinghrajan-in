## üí° **Pro Tips for Maximum Efficiency**

1. **Reference Files**: Say "use project context" instead of explaining your stack again
2. **Build Incrementally**: "Add to existing hero section" vs explaining the whole component
3. **Use Phase Numbers**: "Phase 1 feature" immediately tells me the scope
4. **Specify Urgency**: "High priority" vs "nice to have" helps me prioritize
5. **Tech Shortcuts**: "Standard React pattern" vs explaining component structure

## üöÄ **Getting Started Commands**

Ready to start? Use any of these:

```bash
# Immediate setup
"Setup Phase 1 Rails project with Docker and Tailwind on desinghrajan.in"

# Specific feature
"FEATURE: Hero Section | PHASE: 1 | PRIORITY: High | ACTION: Create with Hotwire"

# Progressive building
"BUILD_ON: Rails setup | ADD: Navigation partial | STYLE: Tailwind design"
```

**Remember**: The more specific and structured your request, the more accurate and efficient my response will be! üéØ
