## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Technology Decisions

- **Database:** Start with SQLite for development, migrate to PostgreSQL for production
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js for scalability and provider flexibility
- **Payments:** Stripe for international support and developer experience
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary or AWS S3 for client file uploads
- **Email:** Resend or SendGrid for transactional emails

### Performance Considerations

- Implement incremental static regeneration (ISR) for blog posts
- Use React Query for client-side state management
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider CDN for static assets

### Security Priorities

- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure file upload handling
- Regular security audits
